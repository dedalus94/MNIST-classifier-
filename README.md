# MNIST-classifier

A jupyter notebook to show how I developed a Neural Network that can identify handwritten numbers with high accuracy (>95%) and without using convolutions.
This project is part of Udacity's nanodegree programme in Deep Learning and it is part of the first module dedicated to Basic Neural Network architecture. 
The data was split in 3 datasets: train, validation and test. 
Since I tested different hyperparameters and different structures (including dropouts) and since they have been evaluated using results on the validation set, the test set result should be used 
to determine the 'real' accuracy of the model.
